# App Architecture (`src/react-app/` + `src/app/`)

`apps/app` is a React 19 + Vite app. It is the UI for every iPolloWork
deployment: the Electron desktop shell loads it, plain web serves it, and it
talks to ipollowork-server / opencode / Den over HTTP. (The Solid runtime it
replaced is fully removed; `src/index.react.tsx` is the only entry.)

## Dependency rules (enforced, all verified by `madge --circular`: zero cycles)

1. `src/app/` and `src/i18n/` never import from `src/react-app/` or
   `src/components/`. If something in the agnostic layer needs UI behavior,
   invert it (callback registration) or move the primitive down.
2. Leaf modules (`runtime-env`, `desktop-types`, `den-types`, `extensions`)
   import nothing (or types-only from other leaves). Low-level clients
   (`opencode`, `ipollowork-server`, `den`) import leaves — never the `utils/`
   barrel (it drags in i18n).
3. `kernel/` and `infra/` sit below `domains/`: they must not import domain
   code. Shared query/state infrastructure lives in `infra/`.
4. `shell/` sits on top and may import everything.
5. Wire contracts shared with other processes live in `packages/types`
   (e.g. `WorkspaceWire`); producer types assert assignability against them.

Toasts are rendered with `sonner` (`@/components/ui/sonner`), mounted once via
`<Toaster />` in `shell/providers.tsx`, driven imperatively with `toast()`.

## Data flow

```text
src/index.react.tsx                       React entry
  └─ QueryClientProvider + PlatformProvider
     └─ react-app/shell/providers.tsx     (AppProviders composition)
        ServerProvider
        └─ GlobalSDKProvider
           └─ GlobalSyncProvider
              └─ LocalProvider
                 └─ react-app/shell/app-root.tsx → routes
                    ├─ shell/session-route.tsx   → domains/session
                    ├─ shell/settings-route.tsx  → domains/settings, connections
                    └─ domains/{workspace,cloud,onboarding} flows
```

## State ownership

- `react-app/kernel/store.ts`: app-wide Zustand store; domain selectors in
  `kernel/selectors.ts`.
- `react-app/infra/query-client.ts`: TanStack Query singleton.
  `react-app/infra/provider-list-query.ts`: shared provider-list cache used by
  kernel, shell, and connections.
- Feature state tightly coupled to one domain lives inside that domain
  (`domains/session/sync/`, `domains/settings/state/`).

## Active workspace and session

Workspace and session identity are route state, not app-global mutable state.

Canonical workspace-scoped routes:

- `/workspace/:workspaceId/session`
- `/workspace/:workspaceId/session/:sessionId`
- `/workspace/:workspaceId/settings/:tab`
- `/workspace/:workspaceId/settings/extensions/:section`

Use `react-app/shell/workspace-routes.ts` to build these paths. Do not
hand-build `/session/...` or `/settings/...` URLs for workspace-scoped flows.

Rules for agents and future code:

- In session or workspace-scoped settings routes, read the active workspace
  from the URL `workspaceId` param first.
- Read the active session from the URL `sessionId` param. A selected session
  should never imply a different workspace than the URL workspace.
- The legacy `ipollowork.react.activeWorkspace` and
  `ipollowork.react.sessionByWorkspace` values are only restore/fallback memory.
  They are not authoritative while a workspace-scoped URL is active.
- `/session`, `/session/:sessionId`, and `/settings/*` are compatibility entry
  points. They should redirect to workspace-scoped URLs when the workspace can
  be resolved.
- Missing URL resources should not silently fall back to the first workspace.
  Show a not-found state and let the user pick from the sidebar.
- Workspace-scoped actions (rename workspace, create session, open
  MCP/settings tabs, quick actions, commands, delete session) should use the
  URL-derived workspace/session context or receive explicit ids from the
  caller.

Practical examples:

- From session B in workspace B, opening settings navigates to
  `/workspace/B/settings/general`.
- Opening a session from the command palette navigates to
  `/workspace/<owner-workspace-id>/session/<session-id>`, owner found from the
  session list.
- Creating a new task in a workspace navigates to
  `/workspace/<workspace-id>/session/<new-session-id>`.

## Testing

- Unit: `bun test tests/` (CI-gated). Pure logic and parsers belong here.
- Smoke/e2e: `pnpm test:e2e` and `scripts/*.mjs` (health, sessions, events).
- UI evals: `pnpm evals` from the repo root drives the real app.
